GLVis is a multiplatform OpenGL application and can be built on Linux/Unix
systems, including Mac OS X, and under Windows.

Besides a C++ compiler, GLVis depends on the following external packages:

- the MFEM library (use the latest release) plus any libraries that MFEM was
  built to depend on
  https://mfem.org

- the OpenGL library
  https://www.opengl.org

- the GLEW library; used for setting up OpenGL functions and extensions
  http://glew.sourceforge.net

- the GLM library; used for computing OpenGL-related mathematics
  https://glm.g-truc.net

- the SDL2 library; used for platform-native window and event management
  https://www.libsdl.org

- the FreeType 2 and Fontconfig libraries; used for font rendering
  https://www.freetype.org, https://www.fontconfig.org

- the libpng or libtiff library; used for taking screenshots (optional)
  http://www.libpng.org, http://www.libtiff.org

- the XQuartz app (on Mac OS X, if running GLVis remotely through ssh)
  https://www.xquartz.org

There are two build systems, one based on GNU make and one based on CMake, as
described below. Choose the one that matches the build system you used to
build MFEM.

In addition to the native build systems, a GLVis package is also available
in the Spack package manager, https://github.com/spack/spack.


Building with GNU make
======================
GLVis comes with a standard makefile, which can be adjusted to specify the paths
to the external libraries, the compiler flags, etc.

Some of the available 'make' targets are:

make       -> Builds the glvis binary, using the MFEM compiler and options
make opt   -> Builds an optimized version
make debug -> Builds a debug version
make app   -> Builds a Mac OS application bundle
make clean -> Cleans the build
make style -> Format the code with Artistic Style.
make help  -> Prints a short help message

Information about the current build configuration can be viewed using

   make status
   make info

An optional installation of the glvis executable can be performed with

   make install [PREFIX=<dir>]


Building with CMake
===================
GLVis may also be configured using CMake to find dependencies. This is the only
supported build method for native Windows builds with Visual Studio.

NOTE: You must have built MFEM using CMake to build GLVis using CMake.

An example invocation of CMake may be:

cmake \
    -G Ninja \
    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING=/path/to/glvis/install \
    \
    -D GLVIS_USE_LIBTIFF=OFF \
    -D GLVIS_USE_LIBPNG=ON \
    \
    -D MFEM_DIR=/path/to/directory/with/MFEMConfig.cmake \
    \
    /path/to/glvis/source

Some important variables for CMake are:

- MFEM_DIR: This is the MFEM build or install prefix. Can be used if the MFEM
     location is not auto-detected correctly.

- mfem_DIR: (alternative to MFEM_DIR) This is the location of the configuration
     file MFEMConfig.cmake that is created during the build and/or install of
     MFEM. You may use either the build directory's config file or the install
     directory's config file.

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Most common options are "Debug" and "Release" [default].

- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Top-level directory for the install. GLVis will be
     installed to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin. Default is "/usr/local".

- GLVIS_USE_LIBPNG: Use libpng for creating screenshots. Default is "ON".

- GLVIS_USE_LIBTIFF: Use libtiff for creating screenshots. Default is "OFF".

- GLVIS_MULTISAMPLE and GLVIS_MS_LINEWIDTH: See building considerations below
     for more information on these variables.


Some building considerations
============================

- On most Linux distributions, the required dependencies (except MFEM) can be
  installed via a package manager.

  On Ubuntu/Debian, the required dependencies can be installed by running:

     apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype-dev libsdl2-dev \
        libglew-dev libglm-dev libpng-dev

  On Fedora/RHEL, the required dependencies can be installed by running:

     dnf install fontconfig-devel freetype-devel SDL2-devel glew-devel \
        glm-devel libpng-devel

  On Mac OS X, the required dependencies can be installed with Homebrew:

     brew install fontconfig freetype sdl2 glew glm libpng

  Package names in other distributions may vary.

- On Windows, GLVis can be built in two ways:

  1) Via a Linux-compatible environment, such as Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for
     Linux (WSL).

     Install the required dependencies, following the directions above for your
     WSL environment's Linux distribution, then continue with the build method
     of your choice.

     For WSL, you may also need to install an X server to run GLVis, such as
     VcXsrv (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).

  2) As a native Windows executable. This enables support for platform-native
     visualization windows, as well as the modern OpenGL backend.

     Visual Studio or another Windows-compatible compiler is required.

     It is recommended to install dependencies via vcpkg:

        vcpkg install fontconfig freetype sdl2 glew glm libpng \
           --triplet=x64-windows

     After installing, proceed with the CMake configuration process, making sure
     to point the CMake variable CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE to the correct path, based
     on the directory where you installed vcpkg. More directions can be found in
     the link below:

        https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/installing-and-using-packages/#cmake

     You may then open the generated Visual Studio project files to build GLVis,
     or call the following command from the GLVis project root directory:

        cmake --build [build directory] --parallel

- In case packaged versions of the needed libraries are not available, download
  and build instructions are included below for GLM, GLEW, and SDL2.

- To adjust the anti-aliasing settings for your hardware:

  1) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MULTISAMPLE variable (multisample mode) in
     the makefile or CMake invocation. Supported values can be obtained from
     the 'glxinfo' command ('ms' columns) or a from a tool like
     'nvidia-settings'.

  2) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MS_LINEWIDTH variable (anti-aliased line
     width) in the makefile or CMake invocation. Note that the same value can
     produce different results depending on the OpenGL implementation.

  3) The above options and some other built-in defaults can be overwritten with
     command line options, see glvis -h for short help.

- GLVis can be built without libpng/libtiff by setting the makefile variables
  GLVIS_USE_LIBPNG/GLVIS_USE_LIBTIFF to NO or setting the same variables to OFF
  during cmake configuration. In this case, GLVis uses SDL to take screenshots
  in .bmp format, which are then converted to .png using `convert`.

- Support for secure sockets using the GnuTLS library through MFEM can be
  enabled by configuring and compiling MFEM with the option MFEM_USE_GNUTLS=YES,
  see MFEM's INSTALL for more details. In addition, in order for this to work,
  one needs to generate GLVis server/client key pairs (in ~/.config/glvis),
  similar to ssh keys. The script 'glvis-keygen.sh' can be used to do that:

     bash glvis-keygen.sh ["Your Name"] ["Your Email"]

- On Mac OS X, GLVis can be built as a native application bundle using the 'make
  app' target (with both the makefile and CMake build systems).

Dependency building instructions
================================
Note that using the build locations given below will let the GLVis build systems
(GNU make and CMake) find these libraries automatically.

-----
 GLM
-----
From the directory containing the 'glvis' directory run the command:

git clone https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git

or the sequence of commands:

wget "https://github.com/g-truc/glm/archive/0.9.9.8.tar.gz"
mv 0.9.9.8.tar.gz glm-0.9.9.8.tar.gz
tar zxf glm-0.9.9.8.tar.gz
ln -s glm-0.9.9.8 glm

GLM is a header-only library, no building is necessary.

------
 GLEW
------
From the directory containing the 'glvis' directory run the commands:

wget "https://github.com/nigels-com/glew/releases/download/glew-2.1.0/glew-2.1.0.tgz"
tar zxf glew-2.1.0.tgz
ln -s glew-2.1.0 glew

To build the library run the commands (see also glew/README.md):

cd glew
make -j 4
cd ..

------
 SDL2
------
From the directory containing the 'glvis' directory run the commands:

wget "https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.12.tar.gz"
tar zxf SDL2-2.0.12.tar.gz

To build the library run the commands (see also SDL2-2.0.12/INSTALL.txt):

cd SDL2-2.0.12
./configure --prefix=`dirname $PWD`/SDL2
make -j 4
make install
cd ..
