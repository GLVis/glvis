GLVis is an X11 application and can be built on Linux/Unix systems including
Mac OS X using the X11/XQuarz app and under Windows using Cygwin/X.

Besides a C++ compiler, GLVis depends on the following external packages:

- the MFEM library (use the latest release) plus any libraries that MFEM was
  built to depend on
  http://mfem.org

- the GL, GLM, and GLEW libraries
  http://www.opengl.org, https://glm.g-truc.net, http://glew.sourceforge.net

- the SDL2 library
  https://www.libsdl.org/index.php

- the FreeType 2 and Fontconfig libraries; used for font rendering
  http://www.freetype.org, http://www.fontconfig.org

- the XQuarz app (on Mac OS X)
  http://www.xquartz.org/

- the libpng or libtiff library; used for taking screenshots (optional)
  http://www.libpng.org, http://www.libtiff.org

- Cygwin/X (on Windows); install the packages xinit, libpng-devel,
  fontconfig-devel, libGLU-devel.
  https://cygwin.com, https://x.cygwin.com

There are two build systems, one based on GNU make and one based on CMake, as
described below. Choose the one that matches the build system you used to
build MFEM.

In addition to the native build systems, a GLVis package is also available
in the Spack package manager, https://github.com/LLNL/spack.


Building with GNU make
======================
GLVis comes with a standard makefile, which can be adjusted to specify the paths
to the external libraries, the compiler flags, etc.

Some of the available 'make' targets are:

make       -> Builds the glvis binary, using the MFEM compiler and options
make opt   -> Builds an optimized version
make debug -> Builds a debug version
make clean -> Cleans the build
make style -> Format the code with Artistic Style.
make help  -> Prints a short help message

Information about the current build configuration can be viewed using

   make status
   make info

An optional installation of the glvis executable can be performed with

   make install [PREFIX=<dir>]


Building with CMake
===================
GLVis may also be configured using CMake to find dependencies.

NOTE: You must have built MFEM using CMake to build GLVis using CMake.

An example invocation of CMake may be:

cmake \
    -G Ninja \
    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING=/path/to/glvis/install \
    \
    -D GLVIS_USE_LIBTIFF=OFF \
    -D GLVIS_USE_LIBPNG=ON \
    \
    -D MFEM_DIR=/path/to/directory/with/MFEMConfig.cmake \
    \
    /path/to/glvis/source

Some important variables for CMake are:

- MFEM_DIR: This is the MFEM build or install prefix. Can be used if the MFEM
     location is not auto-detected correctly.

- mfem_DIR: (alternative to MFEM_DIR) This is the location of the configuration
     file MFEMConfig.cmake that is created during the build and/or install of
     MFEM. You may use either the build directory's config file or the install
     directory's config file.

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Most common options are "Debug" and "Release" [default].

- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Top-level directory for the install. GLVis will be
     installed to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin. Default is "/usr/local".

- GLVIS_USE_LIBPNG: Use libpng for creating screenshots. Default is "ON".

- GLVIS_USE_LIBTIFF: Use libtiff for creating screenshots. Default is "OFF".

- GLVIS_MULTISAMPLE and GLVIS_MS_LINEWIDTH: See building considerations below
     for more information on these variables.


Some building considerations
============================

- On most Linux distributions, the required dependencies (except MFEM) can be
  installed via a package manager. Usually it is sufficient to install the
  packages: libGLU-dev, libpng-dev, and fontconfig-dev with their dependencies
  (actual packages names may vary).

- To adjust the anti-aliasing settings for your hardware:

  1) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MULTISAMPLE variable (multisample mode) in
     the makefile or CMake invocation. Supported values can be obtained from
     the 'glxinfo' command ('ms' columns) or a from a tool like
     'nvidia-settings'.

  2) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MS_LINEWIDTH variable (anti-aliased line
     width) in the makefile or CMake invocation. Note that the same value can
     produce different results depending on the OpenGL implementation.

  3) The above options and some other built-in defaults can be overwritten with
     command line options, see glvis -h for short help.

- If your X11 server does not support GLX 1.3, you can build GLVis to only use
  GLX 1.0 calls, by specifying the GLVIS_GLX10 define. Note that the X11.app
  in OS X may complain about GLX 1.3 support, but in practice works fine with
  GLVis. To define this in CMake, pass "-D GLVIS_USE_GLX10=ON" to cmake.

- GLVis can be built without libpng/libtiff/ by setting
  the makefile variables USE_LIBPNG/USE_LIBTIFF/ to NO or by
  passing GLVIS_USE_LIBPNG/GLVIS_USE_LIBTIFF to cmake.

- On Mac OS X, it is better to start manually the XQuarz app, before starting
  GLVis, in order to avoid the wait for establishing the first X11 connection.

- Support for secure sockets using the GnuTLS library through MFEM can be
  enabled by configuring and compiling MFEM with the option MFEM_USE_GNUTLS=YES,
  see MFEM's INSTALL for more details. In addition, in order for this to work,
  one needs to generate GLVis server/client key pairs (in ~/.config/glvis),
  similar to ssh keys. The script 'glvis-keygen.sh' can be used to do that:

     bash glvis-keygen.sh ["Your Name"] ["Your Email"]
