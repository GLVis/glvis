GLVis is an OpenGL tool for visualization of finite element meshes and
functions. It is a multiplatform OpenGL application that can be built on
Linux/Unix systems, including Mac OS X, and under Windows. It can also be used
in a Jupyter notebook, or in a web browser, see https://glvis.org/live.

For building instructions, see the file INSTALL. Copyright information and
licensing restrictions can be found in the file COPYRIGHT.

When started without any options, glvis starts a server which waits for a socket
connections (on port 19916 by default) and visualizes any received data. This
way the results of simulations on a remote (parallel) machine can be visualized
on the local user desktop.

GLVis can also be used to visualize a mesh with or without a finite element
function (solution), as in 'glvis -m cube.mesh3d'. For parallel computations,
GLVis supports input from several parallel socket connections as well as the
visualization of parallel meshes and grid functions saved in separate files from
the command line as in 'glvis -np 4 -m mesh -g solution'. In both cases, it will
stitch the results to show the global mesh and solution. GLVis can also run a
batch sequence of commands (GLVis scripts), or display previously saved socket
streams. For a complete list of command line options, type 'glvis -h'.

Depending on the data type, variety of manipulations can be performed by using
the mouse and by typing (case sensitive) keystrokes in the GLVis window. Here is
a partial list of the available functionality. Some of these keys can also be
provided as input, using the '-k' command-line option and the 'keys' script
command.

Mouse functions
===============
Left       - Rotate the viewpoint
Middle     - Translate the viewpoint
Right      - Zoom in (up) / Zoom out (down)
Left+Shift - Start spinning the viewpoint (according to dragging vector)


Basic key commands
==================
h - Prints a short help message in the terminal

r - Reset the plot to 3D view
R - Cycle through the six 2D projections (camera looking in +/- x/y/z
    direction)
j - Turn on/off perspective
s - Turn on/off unit cube scaling

c - Toggle the colorbar and caption display state
C - Change the main plot caption
p/P Cycle forward/backwards through color palettes (lots of options, use F6 for
    a menu)
t - Cycle materials and lights (5 states)
l - Turns on/off the light
g - Toggle background color (white -> black)

a - Toggle the bounding box axes
    The options are: -> none
                     -> bounding box with coordinates of the corners
                     -> bounding box without coordinates
                     -> red, green, blue colored main x, y, z axes; dashed box
m - Toggle the "mesh" state
    The options are: -> no mesh or level lines
                     -> draw the element edges (i.e. the mesh)
                     -> draw the level lines (use F5 to modify the level lines)
e - Toggle the "elements" state (see below for vector functions)
    The options are: -> show surface elements (corresponding to the function)
                     -> show no surface elements
                     -> show element attributes (2D)
                     -> show element det(J) (2D)
                     -> show element 1/det(J) (2D)
                     -> show element kappa (2D)
                     -> show element kappa + 1/kappa (2D)

S - Take an image snapshot or record a movie (in spinning mode).
    By default, the screenshots are taken in png format, using libpng. When
    GLVis is compiled with libtiff support (see INSTALL) then the screenshots
    are taken internally and saved in TIFF format (.tif extension). If both of
    these options are disabled during the build process, GLVis will use SDL to
    take screenshots in bmp format, which it will then convert to png if
    ImageMagick's 'convert' tool is available.

Ctrl+p - Print to a PDF file using gl2ps. Other vector formats (SVG, EPS) are
    also possible, but keep in mind that the printing takes a while and the
    generated files are big.

q - Exit
